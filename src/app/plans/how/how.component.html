      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <p>My husband and I are an average couple who lives and works in London.</p>
      <p>
        Like everyone else, we try to pay attention to what we eat. We always knew: home cooking is the key to ensure the food quality
        and save money.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, urban life has often left us very little or close to no time for cooking a dinner. Not to mention grocery shopping…
      </p>
      <p>
        Our weekly routine was to go grocery shopping over the weekend, get random ingredients and leave figuring out dishes to cook
        till later. That's how I ( person with better cooking skills
        <i class="material-icons">

         ), would always end up having my mind busy, puzzling out “What to cook for dinner?” and “What’s in my fridge? “ while commuting
        home every night. Often,to tired to thinking, I would pop into the nearest takeaway and get whatever the shop has
        to offer.
        <br/> Thats how, at the end of the week, we had no choice but to bin the rotten vegetables…
        <br/>Sad but true!
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m not going to write the endless story about children starving somewhere in the world and limited resources on the overpopulated
        planet, I'll just say:
        <strong>“That's not how it should be!”</strong>

      <h3>What?</h3>
      <p>
        With that in mind, we decided to be more organised and created a Lazy Menu - a vast list of, fairly easy to make and nutritious,
        dishes that we like. This way we could rotate and methodize recipes for every week. Next thing we did is extracted
        shopping list from the generated menu.

      <h3>How?</h3>
      <p>
        Since we both happen to be Web Developers, we made it all the way we know best.
