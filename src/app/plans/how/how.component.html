      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <p>We are an average couple who lives and works in London.</p>
      <p>
        We try to pay attention to how we eat, and home cooking is the key to ensure the food quality for a reasonable price.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, urban life leaves us very little or no time to cook. Not to mention grocery shopping…
      </p>
      <p>
        Our routine was to do grocery shopping over the weekend. Get random ingredients and leave figuring out dishes to cook till
        later. Commuting home every night we would be puzzling out “What to cook for dinner?” or “What’s in our fridge?“.
        Tired to think, I would pop into the nearest takeaway and get whatever the shop has to offer.
        <br/> Than, at the end of the week, we had to bin the rotten vegetables…
        <br/>Sad, but true!
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway lets not touch the story about limited resources on the overpopulated planet...

      <h3>What?</h3>
      <p>
        With that in mind, we created a Lazy Menu - a vast list of, hassle free and nutritious, dishes we like. This way we can rotate
        and methodize recipes for every week. Next thing we did is extracted shopping list from the generated menu.

        are welcome to use it.
